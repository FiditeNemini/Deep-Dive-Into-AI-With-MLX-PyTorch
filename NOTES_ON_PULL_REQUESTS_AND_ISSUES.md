# Pull Requests vs. Issues

Just in case someone might get confused about these two GitHub features: Pull Requests vs. Issues

1. **Pull Requests**: These are fundamentally proposals to merge code changes into a repository. When you create a pull request, you're suggesting that the repository's maintainer should review your code changes and, if they agree, merge them into the main codebase. Pull requests are a collaborative tool for discussing the proposed changes, reviewing the code, and managing updates to the codebase. Basically, you are asking me for permission to edit the book yourself.

2. **Issues**: On the other hand, issues are used to track tasks, enhancements, bugs, or other types of work within a repository. They're like a to-do list for the project. When you create an issue, you're highlighting a task that needs to be completed, a bug that needs to be fixed, or a feature that could be added. Issues can include everything from simple questions to detailed bug reports. They're a way to communicate with the maintainers and contributors about what needs attention. Yes, this is how you let me know what you want. Not pull requests.

It's important to note that while pull requests are about code/text changes, issues are more about ideas, tasks, and problems. Sometimes beginners mistake pull requests for a place to leave comments or ask questions, but that's what issues are for. Pull requests should only be used when you have code or text that you want to have added to the project, similar to how you would edit the repository yourself, like a wiki.
