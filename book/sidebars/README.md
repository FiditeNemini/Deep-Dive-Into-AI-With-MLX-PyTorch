# Notes on Sidebars

Unlike other documentation, sidebars in my book are NOT optional. They are core fundamental parts of the book.

Without a solid understanding of the concepts made easy in sidebars, you will not be able to fully understand the rest of the book.

Information in sidebars is presented in a way that is easy to understand and digest. They are not meant to be read in order.

Informational snippets that could be referenced in multiple places in the book are placed in the `book/sidebars` folder.
