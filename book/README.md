# Dive into AI with MLX and PyTorch - The Book

## Part I

![ai-kitchen.png](images%2Fai-kitchen.png)

In Part I of the book, we journey through the foundational elements of Artificial Intelligence, demystifying its core principles and exploring its diverse applications. Through the creation and refinement of Tenny, a sophisticated AI model for stock price prediction, we delve into practical AI methodologies, focusing on data handling, algorithmic intricacies, and machine learning techniques. This section serves as both an introduction to the AI landscape and a hands-on guide, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of AI basics and its transformative impact in the financial sector.

Tenny, the Analyst, is being used for a typical regression task. In regression models, the goal is to predict a continuous output variable based on one or more input features. In the case of Tenny, the objective is to predict the 'Normalized Price', a continuous variable, based on various financial indicators over different fiscal quarters. This is a quintessential example of a regression problem in machine learning, where you're not just classifying data into categories but predicting actual numeric values.

In Part II, we'll delve into the art of **classification**. We will upgrade Tenny, the Analyst to Tenny, the Stock Classifier. We'll explore the nuances of classification, the different types of classification problems, and the various techniques used to solve them. We'll also learn how to craft our own classification criteria, based on our understanding and perspective. Finally, we'll train Tenny, the Stock Classifier, with our dataset and evaluate its performance. Real world examples with real world data.
