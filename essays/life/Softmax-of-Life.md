# Softmax(Life): Balancing the Equation of Innate Talents and Honed Skills
![softmax-of-life.png](images%2Fsoftmax-of-life.png)
Allow me to offer one more piece of advice since we're on a roll.

Contrary to what many might think given my broad expertise in coding, statistics, science, finance, etc, you might guess I've always excelled at math.

Not quite.

I was just like many of you, not exactly a fan of math. Yes, perhaps it was uninspiring teachers, among other reasons... But it felt as though I had an intrinsic struggle with numbers.

To conquer this, I had to exert additional effort, smart effort, akin to overcoming a debuff in a game.

Nonetheless, I recognize one natural talent I have: an affinity for languages. I learn languages quickly, whether they are spoken by people or utilized in programming. Fluent in Korean, proficient in English, and with a firm understanding of Japanese, Chinese, and a bit of French and Spanish, I'm confident that with the right focus, I can gain a reasonable proficiency in any language in just days, without the need for mechanical memorization of vocabulary. Reading comprehension is almost second nature to me.

That's essentially the scope of my natural abilities. Also, just to share another piece of trivia: as some of you may already be aware, I have an intense focus on productivity and optimization that hovers close to the threshold of obsessive-compulsive disorder. I'm not sure if that's a buff or a debuff, but it's a part of me. Sometimes it acts as a benefit, other times it feels like a significant hindrance.

I excel at distilling complex ideas into easily understood terms. This ability, however, has been mostly honed rather than innate. Throughout my life, I've been dedicated to simplifying and articulating concepts in my own words, as some of you might recall. Even after I stopped making YouTube content, I've kept my broadcasting gear.

If you excel in one aspect, statistically, it suggests you might be less proficient in others. Think of this as the softmax(life) rule. Excelling in a specific skill often comes at the cost of not being as skilled in others. Consider the many historical geniuses. Take Einstein as an example – by common standards, he was not a genius in the typical sense of the word.

And we won't even get started on current figures. You likely know someone – immensely talented, nearly surreal in their brilliance, yet in real life, they might not fit the mold we normally ascribe to such intellectual giants. (Ahem, Elon, *cough* *cough*...)

Whether it's a bonus or a penalty, the interpretation is up to you.

It's as if you're facing Malenia in Elden Ring with all your skills, innate or sharpened, which together always total 100%, or 1.
