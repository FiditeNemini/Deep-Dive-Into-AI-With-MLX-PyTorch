# The Perils of Rushed Learning - An Object-Oriented Perspective
![rushed-learning.png](images%2Frushed-learning.png)
Everything's an object, right? So, think about it like this:

Say you get something wrong. That misunderstanding leads to another misstep. It's like getting a messed-up class in coding, which then leads to more messed-up classes. You end up with a whole messed-up family of knowledge classes.

```python
class AbstractClass:
    # Basic class with potential flaws
    pass

class FlawedClass1(AbstractClass):
    # Inherits from AbstractClass
    pass

class FlawedClass2(FlawedClass1):
    # Inherits flaws from FlawedClass1
    pass

class FlawedClass3(FlawedClass2):
    # Inherits compounded flaws from FlawedClass2
    pass

# Infinite loop to create instances of FlawedClass3
knowledge_nuggets = []
while True:
    knowledge_nuggets.append(FlawedClass3())
    # This will continuously create instances of FlawedClass3
```

Look at all those compounded knowledge nuggets! They're all flawed, and they're all inheriting f
laws! It's like a family of flawed classes. And it's all because of that one mistake you made at the start.

Eventually, you gotta go way back to the start to fix everything. It's a total time-waster. That's why I'm not into rushing through learning stuff.

The first thing you learn â€“ that's super important. That should be super solid.

Everything you learn after builds on that. Rushing might seem smart for now, but trust me, it's pretty dumb in the long run.

Slow and steady even wins the learning race.
