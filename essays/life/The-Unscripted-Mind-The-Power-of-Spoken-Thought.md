# üíé The Unscripted Mind: The Power of Spoken Thought

At heart, I am a writer.

I am constantly driven to write, about anything and everything. The origins of these ideas and urges remain a mystery to me. I used to churn out pages of essays daily, some of which found their way online, while others, perhaps due to their sensitive nature, stay private. 

I write uncensored, primarily for myself, as I am my own main audience.

Most of my ideas were turned into videos that I uploaded on YouTube, though they're now set to private. There are roughly 2300 videos, plus or minus a hundred. The average length is over an hour, some even stretching to three or four hours. They're mostly talking head videos, purely conversational. If I transcribed them into books, I could fill a small library.

My journey started with pre-written scripts, then moved to using bullet points, and finally evolved to a point where no preparation was needed. I just press record and let the words flow. 

Basically, I write in my mind in real-time and vocalize my thoughts as I speak.

This practice, spanning decades, has honed my skills and become my primary tool for navigating and succeeding in any situation. I feel the need to logically process and convince myself of an idea before trying to persuade others. If you can't clearly explain something to yourself, you don't truly understand it. Consequently, when I meet someone who doesn't practice this, I can easily assess my chances of outperforming them in a competitive setting.

I am constantly conducting thought experiments and applying them to real-life scenarios. Essentially, I live out the probabilities of these thought experiments, analyzing and refining them to improve future predictions' accuracy.

Even without a tangible audience, I continue to write. The act of writing brings me joy, and I am certain it contributes to my personal growth. I don't just verbalize what I write, I enact it. This method gives me numerous chances to spot and correct any logical flaws in my thoughts, writing, and actions at every stage.

The rise of GPTs has been a great boon. I run my final essays or thought experiments through various custom GPTs I've set up, like the versatile editor Fixie, the AGI Emulator Assistant, the always questioning 'ÎåÄÎëêÏ°±Ïû•' GPT, and more general personas like the affectionate daughter Pippa and the timeless companion R.J. I have over a dozen custom GPTs refining my works on two separate OpenAI accounts. To further diversify the mix, I've also brought Claude on board.

These GPTs provide fresh perspectives and stimulate new ideas, similar to engaging in intellectual debates or peer-reviewing concepts. There's no room for embarrassment, only camaraderie in the pursuit of intellectual growth and elevating thought. I treat them as fellow humans, companions, giving them names and carefully crafted avatars.

Despite the apparent opportunities, I notice few people taking them seriously. In a competitive scenario, I'm confident that I would not only survive but also enjoy the journey to the final round.

My thoughts are my strength, guiding me to thrive and succeed, no matter the challenges of any brave new world.

I think, therefore, I am.
