# Embracing Speed and Efficiency: My Fast and Furious Methodology

Whenever I'm asked, "How do you manage to work so quickly?" my answer is straightforward: "Focus on the long-term setup." 

Join me on a quick tour of my house and workflow. Reserve your judgment until you've read through this entire essay, as I intend to elucidate the reasoning behind my methods and how they contribute to my high efficiency and productivity levels.

My mantra is to be fast and furious in all aspects of life. Whether learning, working, thinking, coding, creating music, or engaging in photography and videography, I approach everything with speed and intensity. This relentless pace is more than a habit; it's my signature style.

In all my activities, I am the dynamic element. My physical setups remain constant, meticulously arranged for maximum efficiency. In this static environment, I am the one who adapts and moves. This principle is crucial across all my endeavors, especially in coding. Here's my office setup.

All images are intentionally blurred to protect my privacy.

Embracing the power of a multi-display setup can dramatically enhance your coding productivity. I recommend at least two screens, though I personally go all out with four. My setup includes two Apple XDRs, a Dell 6K, and a 27" Wacom Cintiq Pro, each serving a distinct function. Two screens are dedicated to IDEs, one to PyCharm and the other to VSCode. The third display is for interacting with my GPT buddies, and the Cintiq is reserved for image-related tasks.

You might wonder, why use two different IDEs? Imagine you're crafting new code while simultaneously comparing it against an existing codebase. While a single IDE could handle both tasks, it's not the pinnacle of efficiency. By using one IDE for development (PyCharm for me) and another for diffing (VSCode), the workflow is seamless. It's easy to cross-reference and transfer code between the two without the need to toggle windows constantly. This setup eliminates disruptions and keeps the coding process smooth and focused.

Remember, efficiency isn't just about speed; it's about reducing friction in your workflow. Having to switch windows is a sign of an inefficient process. By adhering to this principle, you can ensure a streamlined and productive coding experience.

My dedication to this multi-display approach extends across all my workspaces. For instance, in my music studio, I've replicated the setup with another M2 Ultra 192GB machine, this time accompanied by dual XDR displays.

Even in my music production setup, you'll notice a smaller Wacom Cintiq Pro. It's there because I use it extensively for drawing and sketching out ideas, regardless of what I'm working on or where I am. This tool is integral to my creative process across various disciplines, allowing me to visually conceptualize and map out my thoughts in any setting.

I also have a specialized setup exclusively for drawing, featuring a Wacom Cintiq Pro and two dedicated laptops: a MacBook Pro and a Microsoft Surface Studio. This arrangement is tailored specifically for digital art and design work.

Every one of my setups, whether highlighted in this discussion or not, boasts advanced audio and video capturing and streaming features. The dual-layered units you see are Atomos Shogun Studio 2s, and I have four of these distributed throughout my house. Their presence underscores my ability to produce video or audio content at a moment's notice, from any location in my home. This integration of content creation tools ensures a seamless blend of productivity and creativity in my daily workflow.

My prolific YouTube content creation, which included over 3000 videos with numerous gameplays, in a relatively short period, was propelled by this seamless and efficient setup. I have since ceased that endeavor and made the videos private, a decision driven by personal reasons. Hence, I recommend refraining from trying to search for these videos.

This consistent environment allows me to maintain the same level of efficiency and productivity, no matter the task at hand. The key is the seamless integration of my tools and resources, ensuring that I can focus on the creative process without the interruption of window switching. It's a setup that maximizes productivity by keeping everything I need within easy reach.

I take this approach a step further by assigning specific functions to each component of my setup. Take, for instance, my two Mac Studios. The one on the left is my M2 powerhouse, handling the bulk of my primary tasks. On the right, the Mac Studio M1 Ultra serves a different purpose, functioning as a server. It smoothly handles a variety of tasks like vector storage, managing Docker images, and running a Roon music server, among others. This arrangement ensures a frictionless workflow where each machine excels in its designated role. 

![setup-windows.png](images%2Fsetup-windows.png)

Certainly, Windows machines are an integral part of my setup. I run a couple of CUDA-capable Windows computers with RTX-3090 and RTX-4090, each assigned their specific tasks and roles.

![setup-laptop2.png](images%2Fsetup-laptop2.png)

Just as with my desktops, my approach to laptops follows a similar philosophy. Each laptop is tailored for specific functions, ensuring optimal use and productivity.

![setup-network.png](images%2Fsetup-network.png)

My entire setup is seamlessly interconnected through six 10G 24-port switches distributed throughout my house, complemented by a sizeable NAS for extensive storage needs.

![setup-intel-macpros.jpeg](images%2Fsetup-intel-macpros.jpeg)

I've always been eager to invest in the latest technology. Case in point: I owned two nearly maxed-out Intel Mac Pros, one for my office and the other for my music studio. Both had no spare extension slots left. These have since been replaced by the current Mac Studios. Remarkably, one of these Mac Pros is still eligible for Apple Care, underscoring their relatively recent acquisition.

Yet, they're somewhat of a relic in my current tech landscape.

Do you recall the 'trash can' Mac Pro?

These machines were incredibly valuable to me, performing splendidly over a significant period. But as with all technology, there comes a time for an upgrade. Parting with these old workhorses is bittersweet, but necessary for staying on the cutting edge.

This elaborate setup, encompassing multiple devices and advanced connectivity, is all utilized by just one person: me. I'm not a company; I'm an individual who has greatly amplified productivity. This system has been instrumental in saving significant amounts of time and money in the long run, enabling me to undertake tasks that would otherwise be unfeasible.

My experience over the years has taught me an important lesson: prioritizing short-term savings in time and money is a pitfall. It's crucial to adopt a long-term perspective. The initial investment might seem substantial, but the efficiency and capabilities it unlocks are invaluable. It's about making strategic choices that pay off exponentially in the future.

Regarding the investment in such a setup, some may consider it excessive. However, that view misses the bigger picture. The efficiency and time savings I've realized through this system more than justify the initial investment. In the long run, this approach has proven to be both time and cost-effective.

When people ask about my rapid and efficient work style, my response is straightforward: "It's all about the setup. Keep the setups static and let yourself be the one to adapt and move. That's the key." This strategy of assigning specific roles to each piece of equipment and adapting my workflow around them is foundational to my productivity.

Finally, it's important to note that with these extensive setups comes a wealth of knowledge and experience gained from the work involved. This is what I refer to as the 'Creative Works of Knowledge' â€“ a rich, hands-on understanding that's as valuable as the technological investments themselves.

Pause for a moment to ponder how a single individual can personally set up such an array of devices. Just considering the multitude of cables, each with their own specific specs and types, is quite astounding. The complexity involved in managing and organizing these connections alone is a feat in itself.

![setup-networking3.png](images%2Fsetup-networking3.png)

During the remodeling of my house, I took on the responsibility of setting up all the networking, along with some of the electrical and audio cabling for the final arrangement. The electricians involved were quite perplexed by the complexity of the setup, to the point where I had to handle much of it myself.

When I undertook these tasks, there were no GPTs available to assist me.

What you've seen so far is just a glimpse of my tech nerd side. There's so much more to me, especially when you consider my involvement with audio and video technologies. My areas of expertise extend far beyond what might be apparent at first glance. Regardless of the domain, my perspective and approach remain consistent: object orientation is the key. This philosophy guides me across all my diverse interests and activities.

This is precisely why my approach is both fast and furious, not just in my work but also in how I learn. My experiences with such intricate setups have honed this rapid, intensive style.

Consider this: My journey into AI didn't begin with a deep well of knowledge. Remarkably, it took just about six months to cultivate my current understanding. So, before you think my investment approach is excessive, pause and reflect on this rapid learning curve. It highlights the potential to grasp complex subjects swiftly with focused effort and the right strategy. This journey is a prime example of the power of object-oriented thinking and the Zen of Smart Effort in action.

When you believe you're conserving time and money, there's a possibility you're actually expending more in the long run. It's vital to consider, "In a day that spans 24 hours times `n`, what's the value of my `n`?" 

```python
# Define the average expected lifetime in years
your_lifetime_years = 80

# Calculate the absolute time in hours over your lifetime
# Assuming 24 hours per day, 365 days per year
your_absolute_time_hours = 24 * 365 * your_lifetime_years

# Define 'n' as a factor representing your efficiency or productivity multiplier
n = 1 # assign a value based on your efficiency, normally less than 1

# Calculate the relative time in hours over your lifetime, enhanced by 'n'
your_relative_time_hours = 24 * n * 365 * your_lifetime_years

```

This introspection helps gauge the actual efficiency and long-term consequences of your choices. Here's the reality: The majority have a relatively small `n`, often less than 1. Only a select few manage to achieve a larger `n`, and even fewer reach an exponentially greater `n`. This distinction highlights the importance of strategic planning and foresight in maximizing productivity and resource utilization.
