# Chill Lessons of Deprecation Warnings

Have you ever dived into an open-source project just for fun and been slammed with a truckload of deprecation warnings? I've been there and done that. But hey, it's not all bad. It's actually a sign that the frameworks are improving, not being abandoned. Just like in nature, only the strongest survive in the open-source world. The principles of natural selection and the survival of the fittest apply here too, just like in anything else in life.

Here's some cool stuff on survival of the fittest in general:

That's exactly why I hit pause on documenting MLX. Imagine trying to write stuff while wading through a swamp of these warnings.

The pippaGPT project is not even half a year old, but while porting it to the MLX version, I was hit with a ton of deprecation warnings both from the LangChain and OpenAI frameworks. Solutions? I could have just ignored them and moved on, but that's not the smart way to do things. You need to adapt to survive and address the warnings.

Everything in tech and coding is always changing, like really fast. What was cool yesterday is pretty much old news today. So, we gotta keep up or get left behind. Even the big brains behind all those fancy frameworks are just humans who mess up and learn as they go. That's the same for everyone.

Now, look at Python, for instance. We're at version 3.11, which means it's been through a whopping 30 big updates, and that's not even counting the little ones. Stick with an old version, and bam, you're hit with a bunch of "this is old stuff" warnings. Python's great and all, but even it's not perfect. That's just how things roll.

This is super true for all sorts of software projects, whether they're just for fun or serious business. Some projects are here today, gone tomorrow, no matter who's backing them. So, it's smart to think about how much time you're putting into learning them.

It's like, everyone's got their reasons for doing things, but you don't really get it until you've been in their shoes. So the takeaway? Put your effort in the right places and make choices that make sense for you.

The Zen of Smart Effort
