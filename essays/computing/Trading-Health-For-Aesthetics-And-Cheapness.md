# Trading Health for Aesthetics and Cheapness - My Ergonomic Take

My journey with ergonomic keyboards began with Microsoft, which, to my knowledge, was the pioneer in this field. Back then, ergonomic mice were still a distant concept.

In my early twenties, while deeply involved in translation and coding, I first encountered shoulder and wrist pain. It led me to invest months' earnings in ergonomic equipment, including a keyboard, desk, and chair. Looking back, it ranks as one of my wisest investments.

Since then, I've consistently used ergonomic keyboards and mice, except in unavoidable circumstances like traditional office employment. When I started my own business, I equipped my team with ergonomic workstations, adhering to my standards of workplace health.

_I frequently update my setups. The office arrangement you see is from a few years back._

Ergonomic gear tends to be pricey, particularly desks and chairs, which can seem prohibitively expensive at first glance.

But have you considered the long-term health costs of using non-ergonomic keyboards, mice, desks, and chairs?

Seeing young people using laptops for intense work always concerns me. I personally limit laptop use for significant tasks. During long work journeys, such as when I was vlogging on the move, I always made sure to bring my ergonomic keyboard and mouse, fully aware of the health risks associated with extended laptop use.

My first ergonomic keyboard was from Microsoft. But as the market shifted towards aesthetics, the variety of ergonomic options reduced. I had to find alternatives. Currently, I'm using the Logitech Ergo K860 and MX 3s, owning three sets and replacing them as necessary. The worry is that companies like Logitech might discontinue these ergonomic models, prompting me to consider stockpiling a few extra sets.

_My current office setup._

For desks, I opt for spaciousness, allowing for unrestricted movement and ample room for all necessary items. This often means using a secondary small desk for the keyboard and mouse. Unfortunately, the ergonomic keyboard stand I used to favor has been discontinued.

In my home music room, the desk is specially designed to accommodate a master keyboard, tailored for digital musicians.

Driven by my dedication to ideal ergonomics, I personally designed my office using Sketchup amid my home's renovation. This approach guaranteed the space aligned with my needs for comfort and productivity. I provided these designs to the contractor, working closely with them to ensure my office and much of my home were built exactly as I envisioned. I always ensure I'm deeply involved in every step of a project, as I prefer to have a clear understanding of every detail and be hands-on in all aspects of my work.

Take a look at this Sketchup design. It's my own creation, an office space transformed into a full-fledged ATMOS home theater. The living room setup mirrors this, just with a few extra speakers to really amp up the sound. I love duplicating my setups. That La-Z-Boy recliner was my go-to spot for recording YouTube gaming sessions. But here's a twist: despite its cozy look, it's not the best for your back. The Herman Miller Embody, though? That's where I can park myself for hours on end, totally pain-free.

Regarding chairs, I use the Herman Miller Embody, owning four: three for me and one for my wife.

I even use one in my living room for gaming and movie-watching. While it might not win any aesthetic contests, health is my priority. The Herman Miller Embody, from my extensive experience with various chairs, stands out as the best. It has eliminated any pain issues, and even my initially skeptical wife now sings its praises.

Over nearly four decades of working with various computer setups, I've maintained good health, except when working in non-ergonomic conditions during employment or travel.

Apple users should be particularly wary of the health risks associated with their keyboards, known for causing wrist, finger, and shoulder strain. Health should never be sacrificed for aesthetics.

Many overlook the long-term health impacts of non-ergonomic equipment, often dismissing advice about ergonomic working conditions from older individuals.

As for desks and chairs that seem affordable, they often fail to meet ergonomic standards and are not truly cost-effective. You're essentially paying with your health.

The harsh reality is that by the time you feel the physical repercussions, it might be too late. I've seen colleagues, like one who developed carpal tunnel syndrome in her late twenties, forced to retire prematurely.

I urge young people and parents to prioritize their and their children's health over aesthetics or cost. Remember, the real price is paid in terms of your health.

It's intriguing to see many people appear comfortable with prolonged use of non-ergonomic setups. It's quite a human trait to gamble with health, isn't it? While individual physical resilience varies, allowing some to cope with the strain for an extended period, the risks remain significant, and the potential consequences can be severe. As Bon Jovi aptly put it in his song, it's your life, friends.
