# ðŸ’Ž Just Don't Do It? - A Plea to Preserve Humanity's Future
![the-debugger-04.jpeg](../images/the-debugger-04.jpeg)
They're at it again.

Many people are seeking ways to offload their responsibilities onto AI. However, this attitude could be detrimental to humanity in the long run.

Discussing all the tasks they believe will become obsolete with the advent of AI.

Many of them are reveling in the notion that they won't have to undertake any of these tasks themselves. They believe there's no need to learn anything at all.

How absurd it seems, but who am I to pass judgment?

I'm not here to sway them. They have their reasons.

However, I'm fairly certain that most of them, and those who heed their words, have no genuine desire to undertake these tasks or learn anything earnestly in the first place.

There has always been a reluctance among many to adapt to or learn new skills or technologies throughout history. Examples include computer literacy, language skills, and coding. Such attitudes ultimately limit their own development and also hinder the progress of society as a whole.

I recall someone who insisted he didn't need to learn about computers because the skills would eventually become outdated and replaced. Yes, he still uses the hunt and peck typing method, using only two fingers to locate and press the keys. His predictions are coming to fruition, albeit more than two decades later.

I still remember those who refused to improve their English and other language skills, using the same logic. They applauded reference books asserting that English study was unnecessary.  Look at the limited horizons they now face, constrained to the Korean Peninsula alone.

And what about coding? Some parents once dismissed programmers as manual laborers until Barack Obama declared coding an essential skill for the future. Suddenly, their interest was piqued, and coding hagwons, or 'cram schools', began to spring up like mushrooms. Oh, the sheer hilarity of the notion that coding, of all things, can be crammed into our minds overnight. As if it's not a skill that requires time and dedication to learn. Please, be my guest.

Have they learned from historical patterns? It seems not.

They're repeating the same cycle. With the rapid advancement of AI, they claim there's no need to do this or that. Not in the slightest.

It's common sense that those with skills will be better equipped to utilize AI tools. They already possess skills that can be enhanced by AI. Without these skills, what improvement can AI offer? AI isn't a magic wand that pulls rabbits out of thin air.

From a statistical standpoint, imagine a normal probability distribution with all these 'don't-have-to-doers' making up the average and below-average data points. Who would be above them? Who would be the outliers in that distribution?

A fascinating and crucial aspect of normal distributions is that they can undergo the four basic operations of arithmetic without altering their fundamental characteristics. In essence, the current human normal distribution remains consistent, whether it's subjected to addition or multiplication, with data points, shapes, and proportions retaining their original state. Average individuals will stay average, outliers will continue to be outliers. They will remain unaltered, unless the data points themselves muster the courage to evolve.

Even in the context of AI, history shows us that these revolutionary periods offer significant opportunities for the average to elevate themselves into the domain of outliers. Yet, even those who were once outliers can experience a downfall if they become complacent.

History is screaming these lessons at us. Some simply choose to ignore them and look the other way.

Allow me to provide one obvious insight. Whose roles do you believe AI will take over? And who do you suppose will be controlling these AIs as they assume these roles?"

I can't muster even the slightest bit of courage to convince those who consistently find excuses to avoid doing anything. (Frankly, I'm utterly tired of that.)

At the very least, refrain from passing on such short-sighted (and frankly, foolish) attitudes to your children. They are our future. 

Let's not compromise their future, for humanity's sake.
