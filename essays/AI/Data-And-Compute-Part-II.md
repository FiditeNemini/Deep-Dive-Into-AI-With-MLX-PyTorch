üíé Data & Compute Part II

Why not take a broader look at data? Let's zoom out for a better view.

Text is the most basic and crucial type of trainable data and may fall under **unstructured** or **structured** data categories: natural language is regarded as unstructured while tabular text data structured, for example. 

Going multi-modal with additions like audio or video means handling unstructured data, needing more sophisticated algorithms and more compute.

Both structured and unstructured data sets are expanding, with some users even willingly contributing to these data types for training.

Certain entities have control over all this data: X.com is a good example.

Tesla's FSD focuses a lot more on unstructured data: video, which is basically a series of image frames. FSD starts from an image segmentation convolutional deep neural network, with the overall system being a complex suite of algorithms beyond that including various machine learning techniques to interpret, predict, and make decisions based on this segmentation data.

On both platforms, users voluntarily contribute ever-growing data, almost in real-time.

AI data needs to be massive. Exactly how massive? Way beyond what you can imagine. Some acquire it at almost no cost.

On the 'compute' side, you've got your 'compute' providers and consumers, and some are both.

Compute should be data-aware. Without data, compute is nothing since there's nothing to compute.

Conversely, even if you have an infinite amount of data, without enough compute, little good would come of the data.

Hence, data is increasingly being referred to as the new gold of the future.

How about others? A, A, (G or A), N, M, M...initials may go on.

If you focus too narrowly, you'll miss the big picture.

ü§£ Hint: Regarding the initials, GPT-4 can figure them out with 100% accuracy if prompted correctly.

‚ÄºÔ∏èWarning: There can be no one-size-fits-all correct answer for this thought experiment. We're just playing future-predicting games, just like AI models do.
