# ðŸ’Ž AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning - Vectors, Matrices and Tensors

If you're finding it difficult to grasp the basics of AI, machine learning, or deep learning, such as vectors, matrices, or even tensors, consider the following steps.

Step 1: Start with self-exploration. You'll likely hit a wall and struggle to visualize anything, I assure you.

Step 2: After a series of 'what-the-f*ck' moments, watch the first two lectures by Prof. Gilbert Strang of MIT, which are freely available on YouTube.

Keep revisiting Step 2 until you experience a genuine "a-ha" moment.

However, even after that 'a-ha' moment, you might still be wondering why all these concepts are crucial in AI.

Step 3: Do yourself a favor and read the following book until you come across a linear regression model predicting fish weights in Chapter 3. A linear regression model is the most basic machine learning model, from which you can derive any complex models in an object-oriented way. Having a statistical background would be helpful but is not essential for understanding this basic model.

The insights might hit you like a sledge hammer, as powerfully as Neo's revelations in The Matrix.

You might be tempted to read the book first, but that approach might rob you of the valuable opportunity for enlightenment.

I strongly recommend following these steps. It will require a lot of mental effort but not much of your time: it can all be done in a single day.

Trust me, the insights gained will be invaluable.
