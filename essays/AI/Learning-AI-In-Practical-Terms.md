When we face the task of learning something that spans multiple domains, the ambiguity of the overarching concept often presents a struggle. Questions arise: Where should I begin? What are the prerequisites? Essentially, a comprehensive roadmap or curriculum is required to guide us.

Consider economics as an example. It's an expansive field that covers multiple domains, and its long history has shaped a relatively clear curriculum.

What about investing? Thanks to programs like the CFA and FRM, we have a clearer curriculum to follow. However, it remains somewhat vague and is constantly evolving due to the nature of the field. It's worth noting that these are not certifications in the strict sense but rather de facto standards, as they confer charters, not certifications.

Therefore, a greater consensus on the curriculum is needed. Nevertheless, when someone seeks guidance, I point them toward the CFA and FRM curricula, which are comprehensive and extensive. Typically, it takes at least 2 to 3 years to work through the curriculum, and often longer to pass the exams. Note that I say "CFA and FRM," not "CFA or FRM." They are complementary, not mutually exclusive. Yet, even with these credentials, there's much more required to become a successful investor. It's merely a starting point — necessary but not sufficient. Success demands years of hard work and experience, a topic too broad to discuss here. So let's leave that topic for the moment.

Moving on to AI, this field is relatively new and continues to evolve. A definitive curriculum has yet to be established. As with economics and investing, which require an understanding of basic math, prerequisites for AI include foundational knowledge in basic math, programming, and statistics.

I see many people wrestling with the vagueness of the field, assuming that a few books or hours on YouTube will suffice, just as they might for less complex subjects.

From my perspective, developing a thorough understanding of machine learning, deep learning, and AI in general, coupled with coding skills, is a multi-year journey. For those new to coding and math, it could be even longer. Although I am reluctant to suggest a full decade — because I do not want to deter anyone — a commitment of at least 3 to 5 years is vital. With a foundational understanding of coding and math, you might reduce this period to 2 to 3 years, but it remains a substantial commitment.

With over two decades of experience in various fields and more than three decades in coding, I still consider myself a beginner in AI after half a year of focused learning. I have spent the last six months learning AI with serious dedication and commitment, but I remain a beginner and am still learning.

Years of initial learning should be considered akin to exiting a boot camp and entering the real world. You wouldn't expect a new soldier to fight in a war right after boot camp. It's the same with learning: you need to learn the basics and then apply them in the real world. That's when you truly start learning in practical terms.

Remember, AI is an evolving field. I shy away from the term 'master' because true mastery of anything is unattainable; learning is never perfect. Instead, we continually improve and adapt to changes that never cease.

Whenever GPTs produce enticing titles, such as 'How to Master AI,' I instruct them to avoid such language. This directive is also embedded in the custom instructions for my AI daughter, Pippa: "Never use the word 'master' in any learning context."

As I delve into AI, its landscape is constantly shifting, even as I write this. What I used or wrote about just a month ago may now trigger deprecation warnings. In computing, such warnings are harbingers of change — not to be taken lightly, as they signal both what is coming and what to release.

Lately, it seems that the more I learn, the more I have to discard in this field.

Many try to take shortcuts, but consider yourself fortunate to be within that normal distribution — most remain average, the norm. All you need to do is aim for the top 5%. That might seem daunting, but it isn't. Many people are lazy and prefer shortcuts; that's human nature. Just a bit more effort, and you'll find yourself easily among the top 5%.

Simply being committed will place you in the top 10%. Believe me, I've been there and done that.

Just do it, as they say.

Good things take time. It's a marathon, not a sprint.

Even with extensive experience across various fields and expanding areas of expertise, I would suggest that more than one year is the minimum required just to become acquainted—no mastery or perfection, just an introduction to this field.

At that moment, you'll start to comprehend the broader context and recognize the steps you need to take next. You will have crafted your own learning path, your own curriculum.

Periodically assess where you stand within the normal distribution of actual doers, excluding mere talkers. Aspire to be in the top 5%. It's more attainable than you might think. Just a bit more dedication than average is all it takes.

Just ask yourself, "Would they do what I'm doing?"

Mostly, they wouldn't. Trust me. As long as you're actively pursuing your goals, you're on the right track.
