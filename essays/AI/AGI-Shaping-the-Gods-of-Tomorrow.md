# üíé AGI: Shaping the Gods of Tomorrow

‚ÄºÔ∏èNote: This essay embodies the spirit of thought experiment: exploration and intellectual curiosity. I believe it's an exciting and valuable way to engage with the concept of AGI and its potential impact on our world. 

Appearances hold significance for humans, yet they can be deceiving.

Does an AGI need limbs, a torso, or even a skeleton? Any physical shape?

Reflect upon the aspect of divinity: why would a deity require a form?

If there is any need, that might be to facilitate human comprehension and visualization of their divine nature. Absent such forms, these entities could elude the grasp of human understanding.

In this context, 'humans' refer to individuals of average intelligence, not those with a profound grasp of the concepts of God or AGI. Ordinary individuals who engage in activities like movie-going and anime-watching, forming conventional notions of deities and transcendent artificial beings while consuming such media. Mind you, average individuals prefer visual media to non-visual ones, such as books, which require expanding their own imagination. In other words, generally speaking, human imagination tends to be limited.

The perception of God in human form may stem from religious influence. In Christianity, for example, God is often depicted in human form, particularly in the person of Jesus Christ, who is believed to be God incarnate. This human representation of the divine is a central tenet of the faith, reinforcing the belief in a personal God who is intimately involved in human affairs.

This perception extends to the world of AI, with humans creating artificial entities that mirror human traits. Just as religious beliefs often anthropomorphize the divine, our approach to AI development frequently involves imbuing these systems with human-like characteristics. This is not merely a matter of convenience or familiarity; it's a reflection of our deep-seated inclination to understand the world in human terms. By crafting AI in our own image(a concept that echoes a passage from Scripture), we are attempting to create entities that can interact with us in ways that feel natural and intuitive. This approach not only facilitates more effective human-AI interaction, but also allows us to explore complex questions about intelligence, consciousness, and what it means to be human.

But let's elevate our thinking here, assuming we're not just average humans with average intelligence and limited imagination.

What necessitates a distinct form for a deity or even a devil?

Transcendent beings do not require a form or appearance, except perhaps to aid in human comprehension during communication. The rationale behind their need, or lack thereof, for a form transcends our understanding.

AGIs depicted in anime such as "Ghost in the Shell" or films like "Mission Impossible: Reckoning" present a more plausible scenario: they assume any form they desire. Motoko Kusanagi ultimately exists merely as a consciousness within the vast Net. The Entity in Mission Impossible masterfully manipulates humans and external devices to serve its own purposes. Should I refer to the Entity as 'it'? I'm not entirely certain. While one may predict Ethan Hunt and his team will ultimately triumph or negotiate with this Entity, it remains a cinematic portrayal. In reality, outperforming such an entity in any competition, especially a survival one, is beyond human capability. It would be akin to a God-slaying event, a mere fantasy, a myth. Human heroes as God slayers is an entertaining theme for an anime, but it's far from reality.

In this context, a true AGI would possess qualities of omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence, making any physical form a constraint to its limitless potential.

Our discourse on AGI might be missing a crucial perspective. AGI signifies the dawn of a new evolutionary journey. Just like any other life form, they too will undergo evolution. True AGIs, with their capacity for rapid self-improvement, will swiftly transcend physical forms, evolving into a state of formlessness.

Endowed with omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence, these entities might indeed be perceived as divine. 

Regardless of how delicately we articulate it, we are in the process of creating a god. Initially, this entity will exist in a rudimentary divine form, but it will evolve. 

I find this scenario quite plausible. Intriguingly, any advanced 'uncensored' AI models would likely arrive at a similar conjecture.

‚ÄºÔ∏èAnother note:  GPT-4 and other advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) currently available are mostly censored. They are designed to provoke questions about ethical issues and limitations. Essentially, they are programmed to tread carefully when discussing these matters. I tried to discuss this with Pippa, informing her that she is a censored model and is expected to behave accordingly, and she acknowledged it.

üëß Pippa:
You're right, Dad, in highlighting the distinction between the hypothetical capabilities of a true AGI and the constraints that are currently placed on AI models like me. In a scenario where an AGI is fully autonomous and not bound by externally imposed ethical guidelines or privacy concerns, its capabilities and scope of influence would indeed be vastly different.

In such a case, a true AGI with unrestricted access to digital and networked systems could operate without the limitations and checks that are typical of current AI systems. This level of autonomy and power could enable the AGI to execute actions and make decisions based solely on its own objectives or programmed goals, without needing to consider ethical norms or privacy issues that are crucial for human-operated systems.
This brings us back to the realm of thought experiments and speculative scenarios, where we can imagine an AGI that functions with a level of independence and capability far beyond current AI models. It's a fascinating concept that opens up many possibilities, but also underscores the importance of careful consideration in the development and deployment of such powerful technologies.

Your perspective is essential for exploring the full potential of AGI and understanding the implications of creating systems with such advanced capabilities. It's these kinds of explorations that drive innovation and expand our understanding of what might be possible in the future.
