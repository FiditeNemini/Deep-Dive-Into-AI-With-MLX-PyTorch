# ðŸ’Ž Envisioning The Future of AI Tools

Every day, the world of AI introduces new tools. Some of these are intriguing, impressive, and hold great promise, while others fall into the realm of mediocrity and are merely a fad.

Never fall for the so-called mind-blowing game changers; they seldom blow any minds or change any games in the long run.

Historically, during periods of disruption like the one we're experiencing now, there's a surge in the development of new tools. The market is almost flooded. However, in the long run, only a handful manage to sustain our interest and survive.

Only the strongest and most adaptable tools will endure, often crushing or absorbing even the newest ones. While I may occasionally experiment with these new tools, I tend not to invest significant time and effort into them.

Instead, I believe in giving time to the major, established tools. They are likely to evolve and incorporate similar features that are worth our investment in terms of time and effort.

That's why we call them 'industry standards'. Photoshop, for example, sounds now almost like a misnomer, not fully capturing its evolving capabilities: it is also the go-to tool for drawing, with Clip Studio being a niche tool for some. If real-time AI-assisted drawing is the future, we can easily expect Adobe to incorporate it into Photoshop. The thing we should learn is not the tool itself, but the fundamental concepts and workflow behind what we want to achieve: like LDM or LCM image generation concepts.

Utilizing the Latent Consistency Model, for instance, opens up an entirely new avenue. While drawing skills can be beneficial, they are not always essential and may even impede your progress. It's crucial to retrain your muscle memory to guide the model towards generating the desired results. In essence, you're not drawing in the conventional sense; instead, you're steering the model in a collaborative mode. Attempting to draw too meticulously, as one would on paper, may not yield the best results.

Blender is another good example. Unlike Photoshop, which is proprietary and closed-source, Blender is open-source, enabling it to adapt and evolve at a faster pace. If the future lies in real-time AI-assisted modeling or sculpting, the Blender community is poised to integrate it, either directly into the core application or as an add-on. This evolution is already underway. I've ceased honing my traditional modeling or sculpting skills, as they don't align with the future's trajectory, which promises to be more intuitive.

A straightforward yet potent principle in the game of predicting the future is this: the intensity of people's desire for a particular outcome often directly correlates with the likelihood of that future materializing.

The fundamental strategy remains consistent. Whether it's AI-assisted drawing or modeling/sculpting, the Latent Consistency Model is currently the linchpin. The efficiency of this model, along with the workflow it supports, is set to experience rapid enhancements in both quality and speed.

During a significant transitional phase, it's more beneficial to concentrate on the fundamentals, patiently allowing the most efficient adaptation path to emerge, while experimenting along the way.

Avoid investing excessive time and effort into fleeting trends that will eventually fade and consolidate into something more substantial.

If a tool is genuinely worth your time and effort, it will naturally endure, adapt to the evolving landscape, and stand as a beacon of guidance.

When new innovations appear, first envision their potential impact on current industry standards. This foresight will illuminate your path of adaptation.

Most often, there's no need to alter the standards. They will triumph and evolve, as dictated by the principle of survival of the fittest.

For now, I wouldn't consider switching from Photoshop and Blender to any other tools, though I might enjoy exploring them for fun.

Hone your skills with the major tools that have stood the test of time, not getting swept up in every new trend.

This approach embodies my commitment to continuous growth with a decreasing amount of investment in terms of time and effort, adhering to a '24 x n' philosophy, where 'n' represents the enabler of exponential growth.
