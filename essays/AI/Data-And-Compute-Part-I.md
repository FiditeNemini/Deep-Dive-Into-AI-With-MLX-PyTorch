# ðŸ’Ž Data & Compute

I encourage you to do this thinking experiment, but of course, it's your call.

ðŸ‘‰ Those who possess data and compute will wield immense power in the future.

Which data is fleeting? Which is continuously expanding and evolving?

Which data avoids issues of cost and intellectual property?

For whom is the compute intended?

Who possesses both?

I'll throw in some initials just for fun: A, A, (G or A depending on how you look at it), N, M, M, T.

It might sound counter-intuitive, but some don't even have any meaningfully trainable 'clean' data by any standards, yet too many think they do. In the AI world, compute has dependencies and varying quality and is not always equal, leading to dominance by some.

Completing this assignment on your own will undoubtedly change your perspective on them.

Again, there are good reasons the term 'compute' is bandied around as a noun. Only Claude 2 knows the context, even GPT-4 Turbo thinks it's wrong to use it as a noun. Human language evolves by its users. This term carries more subtlety compared to the phrase 'computing power'. Think about 'why', 'where', and 'how'. Trust me, all those 'AI' nerds and enthusiasts intuitively understand and use it naturally.

Note: Tackling unique experiments like this requires thinking outside the box and adopting a fresh perspective. Please, break free from it.
