# ðŸ¤– Mathematics: The Universal Language and the Heart of AI

Many people are deterred by the mere mention of 'mathematics,' imagining tedious exercises and complex equations before they even have a chance to discover they might love it and be naturally good at it.

Now is a great opportunity to learn and enjoy math. Motivation is the key. With the right drive and curiosity, anyone can appreciate the beauty of math and see its application in everyday life, technology, and the universe. Once that door swings open, it's like stepping into a new world, full of possibilities and answers to questions one might never have thought to ask.

Just as our entire universe is built on mathematics, so is AI.

Math is a kind of magic that makes complex things transparent and clear.

There's no need to engage in tedious exercises or worry about exams.

Subjects like linear algebra, calculus, trigonometry, logarithms, probability, and statistics may seem daunting, but mastering them isn't necessary. Simply understanding their essence and their relevance to AI is enough. Just listen to their stories and what they have to say.

There's ongoing debate about reintroducing matrices to the Korean high school math curriculum by 2025, influenced by the rise of AI. (The reason for their initial removal remains a mystery to me... probably a stupid one.)

Considering AI's surge and its deep foundation in mathematical frameworks, especially matrices, this seems like a move in the right direction. Learning math is akin to learning the language of the universe, and it's essential to equip future generations with this tool.

Comprehending math, and subsequently, the laws underpinning AI and the universe, isn't merely scholarly. It's a path to enlightenment.
