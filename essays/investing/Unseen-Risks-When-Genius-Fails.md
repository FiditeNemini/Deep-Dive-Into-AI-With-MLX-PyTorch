# ðŸ’Ž Unseen Risks - When Genius Fails...

If you have even a smidgen of statistical understanding...

Imagine a game that appears to be a quick path to wealth: you have a 99% probability of winning and a mere 1% chance of... losing your life. Would you take the risk?

The catch? 

That 1% doesnâ€™t come in order. It could be the very first strike. It's how esteemed models like Black-Scholes, boasting 99% success, can still stumble.

The law of large numbers governs probabilities. It presumes that you will carry out experiments numerous times for the probabilities to hold true. For instance, even with a fair coin, a 50% chance of winning isn't guaranteed with a small number of tosses. 

In most cases, you won't have the luxury of of performing the experiment as many times as required.
