# ðŸ’Ž Unraveling the Myth of 100% Confidence

Believing in 100% confidence is likely a misconception. Statistically speaking, achieving absolute confidence is nearly impossible, especially when the universe itself is grounded in statistical laws. Even when observed through quantum mechanics, we're entities influenced by the principle of uncertainty.

Why, then, do we often claim absolute certainty? What fuels this overconfidence?

Let's put it this way: if you're 95% confident, logically, there's a 5% margin for error or uncertainty. This is fundamental in statistical analysis and decision-making.

Exploring this subject is crucial, especially if you're consistently all-in with your actions. Why are you fully invested all the time, for example? Why the total commitment? What propels such confidence? Isn't there room for even a hint of doubt?

Intriguingly, humans seem wired with an overconfidence bias, a phenomenon well-studied in behavioral psychology.

For future strategies, think of this formula: 

    ðŸ‘‰ 0.6 x Scenario A + 0.3 x Scenario B + 0.1 x Scenario C... 

(The sum of the weights should equal to 1: 100%.)

A weighted average approach is a tried-and-true decision-making method, considering the likelihood of each scenario. It provides a practical way to navigate uncertainty and mitigate risks, ensuring longevity in your endeavors.

At least, it'll help you stay in the game for a long run.
