# ðŸ’Ž Natural Selection in the Stock Market

![time-agi-of-the-year.jpeg](../images/time-agi-of-the-year.jpeg)

The stock market epitomizes human folly. 

If I could stake my entire fortune on a single metric that consistently reflects this reality of the stock market, I would be wealthier than anyone else. This is based on the undeniable fact that most people lose money in the stock market.

Some attempt to approximate this elusive metric by shorting the indexes or specific stocks. However, these strategies are not universally applicable and therefore, are unlikely to yield the desired results.

Those with market experience, who can maintain their composure, intuitively understand this: almost everyone loses money. The issue is that there is no universal benchmark to bet for or against. Some genius may invent such a financial instrument, or perhaps already has, but it's not publicly traded. We simply don't know, and mind you, even geniuses fail.

No, I never go short on anything. You may find it hard to believe, but the guilt associated with such actions is more than I can bear. My moral reservations run deep. Even when I'm nearly 99% certain that an index or a specific stock is overbought, I choose to look the other way. These moral dilemmas or qualms arise from the knowledge that such actions can cause harm to people, potentially plunging families and innocent children into a hell of distress. Some short sellers even wish for misfortunes to occur for the sake of larger gains. Don't exempt yourself from this scenario; anyone can cross the moral line. Another reason I refrain from shorting anything is to preserve my humanity. It should be a poignant reminder that financial decisions are not just about numbers and profits but also about real-world consequences for people.

However, a universal instrument presents an entirely different scenario. 

Those who lack the fortitude to wield a sword and take a life directly may find it disturbingly easy to press a button that results in the demise of thousands. In such instances, the moral distinction becomes alarmingly obscured.

Additionally, one might justify such an action by suggesting it imparts a stern lesson for the greater good, a necessary sacrifice to protect the majority, much like some characters did in the movie, 'Oppenheimer.' However, what they often fail to depict in such films are the immediate and prolonged deaths that follow. These tragic consequences are merely mentioned, not visually represented. Having worked as a live TV news translator for a considerable period, I can assure you, the graphic descriptions are something you wouldn't want to hear, let alone see. The indirect trauma is enduring; it never truly fades. I continue to  wrestle even today.

However, I cannot assert with certainty that I will refrain from purchasing such a universal financial instrument, which is founded upon a statistically validated, time-honored theorem indicating that nearly all market participants incur losses in the long run. Irrespective of my decision, the theorem endures as a testament to the market's inherent process of natural selection. Any moral reservations I possess are likely to diminish as time progresses.

About two decades ago, an Australian cruise deck worker reminded me of this stark yet understandable lesson when I asked for her help to save a bird that had collided with the ship and was battling for survival on water. She curtly responded, "It's natural selection; we can't intervene." Understandably, the fact that she was a young woman made the situation even more startling for me. As more tourists expressed their concern, she eventually removed the bird using a hand net, presumably disposing of it discreetly in a nearby trash bin.

Whether that would teach any lesson to the other birds, I'm not entirely sure.

As for whether I could be like that cruise deck worker in the stock market, well...
