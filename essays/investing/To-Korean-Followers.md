# To Korean followers
![market-crash.png](market-crash.png)
As a fellow human being who ought to wish happiness for your family, I'm just going to say it, even though it may be advice you don't want to hear.

I realize many of you Korean followers are here because of my investment track record with Tesla.

I'll be direct.

Over the long haul, the market permits only a tiny fraction of investors to profit. The remainder lose money, sometimes down to their last penny, spelling disaster for their families.

We can categorize that successful fraction of investors:

1. Those who are lucky enough to be born with an innate talent for insights and visions.
2. Those who work hard enough to cultivate or *earn* their insights and visions.

Regarding the first group, they are the chosen ones, like Buffett.

But I have much to say about the second group. Any one of you can belong to this segment, yet not all of you apply sufficient smart effort. In fact, I know from my experience that most of you don't.

The Zen of Smart Effort:

True value comes from enduring, intelligent effort. It can take decades to hone the skill of smart effort.

So, reflect on this: What have you done to earn the money you aim to gain from the market?

Have you matched efforts with someone like me, for instance? In the dog-eat-dog world of the market, if you're looking to make a profit, you should be capable of capturing a share of the investment gains I make. It's a tough pill to swallow, but it's the reality of the game. Can you beat me in the game of smart effort?

You would need to surpass me to land in that enviable fraction of investors â€” the top 1% of the top 1% in the normal distribution of investors. Why? Because I stand at the threshold of that segment, like Iudex Gundyr in Dark Souls III. You have to defeat me to reach the next level of the game. 

Imagine where you stand in this distribution. I implore you, for the sake of your family, your children.

That's all I ask. If you find yourself stuck in the middle of the distribution, you might want to consider exiting the market. I don't want your money. Not a penny of it. Honestly.

Remember: Games give you infinite chances to try again; the market doesn't. It's almost a one-shot deal.
