# ðŸ’Ž "Me vs. Them: A Simple but Seemingly Impossible Investing Tip"

Don't read too much into it; this is just my humble two cents on investing.

When it comes to the market, what you believe is less important than what "they" believe.

Humans fear the unknown, so they come up with 'theories' they can rely on. Many theories come and go this way. I don't believe in any of them, but I know they have to believe in some. Financial AIs are run on these theories too. That's how the market behaves: it's a consensus.

Whether it's the flawed CAPM or the failed Black-Scholes, don't expect them to disappear anytime soon. They're embedded in the algorithms of numerous financial analysts and AIs that the market relies on.

The battle is between you and them. You construct your own model based on the extensive knowledge and experience you've gathered in the market to predict its behavior. If your prediction is wrong, you adjust it accordingly, reducing the error just as AIs do with gradient descent, minimizing prediction error in their pre-training. I'm not referring to market timing when I say 'prediction.' You need to anticipate how they would behave in a given scenario. Without such weighted scenario prediction (a softmax function, so to speak, where the sum of all scenarios adds up to 1), you can't create, manage, or balance your portfolio.

See? I have my "own" philosophy on how I should manage my portfolio and respond to market events. But this philosophy is somewhere between what I've learned and how they would behave, with the latter carrying more weight.

Be honest and rational. What would the majority of so-called investors, traders, and trading AIs do in the current market situation? That's far more important than what I would do. It's just statistical common sense.

The ultimate, somewhat humanly impossible trick, is not to become one of them. 

At the end of the day, the market is a reflection of collective behavior, and understanding that collective mindset is crucial.

Pretending it's "me vs them" is not enough. You must be different from them, and let the records show it.

Just as in a game of poker, it's not about having the best hand, but rather understanding and predicting the behavior of your opponents. In the market, your 'opponents' are the other traders, investors, and algorithms. It's a game of psychology more than it is of pure numbers and data.

That's how I've survived so far.

Finally, one thing is abundantly clear: the future market will be driven by AIs. Humans simply can't resist the urge to use them, and there will be significant failures in the foreseeable future when the majority rely on the same optimized models predicting the same weighted scenarios.

This is one of the reasons why I delve deeper into AIs: I'm simply preparing myself for that riskier future. I would never create any model as they would, exemplifying the "me vs. them" approach. No matter how well-versed I become in deep learning, I wouldn't follow their methods. The funny thing is an AGI wouldn't do what they would do.

The only rational and logical way to survive in such turbulent markets is to maintain a "me versus them" approach.

Understanding the behavior of 'them' should be a more powerful tool than any theoretical or technical analysis or personal belief. 

The most dangerous thing in my humble opinion in investing is to get too caught up in theories and your own and other's beliefs.

Stay sharp and stay rational.
