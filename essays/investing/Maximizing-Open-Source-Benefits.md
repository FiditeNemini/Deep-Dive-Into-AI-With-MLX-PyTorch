A frequently asked question in the realm of open source is, "How is it financially viable to contribute without direct compensation?"

While I may not sway those unacquainted with open source to immediately begin contributing, I can offer insights from my journey and the invaluable advantages I've encountered.

We'll explore this from two perspectives: the individual contributor and the organization.

**For the Individual:**

Consider my story. For over twenty years, I've engaged with the open source community, tracing back to when PHP was a major player in the web development arena.

Financially, my open source ventures have primarily resulted in authoring books for Wrox and translating one into Korean, my native language. This journey introduced me to some of the industry's brightest minds, enriching my knowledge through collaboration.

However, I caution those seeking substantial financial gain from open source. My success is not the norm; open source contributions alone are unlikely to be a significant income source.

So, why continue?

The personal growth and satisfaction derived from contributing are incomparable. The knowledge and experience gained are profound, transcending what can be articulated. The repository I maintain is a testament to this, showcasing extensive contributions made without financial incentives.

Consider the learning and growth one can achieve through such dedication.

This enrichment and fulfillment cannot be attained through monetary pursuits alone. It demands commitment, passion, and community engagement.

From a professional standpoint, passion trumps financial motivation. My career has been shaped by choice, not necessity, allowing me to select projects and collaborators based on shared values and enthusiasm.

**From the Organization's Perspective:**

An organization thrives on the collective passion and commitment of its members.

Successful companies leverage open source to innovate and profit, a strategy employed by giants like Google and Meta. These organizations exemplify how embracing open source can lead to monumental success.

To truly grasp the impact of open source, one must engage with the community. The experience illuminates how open source underpins the digital conveniences we often take for granted.

Consider the foundations laid by open source in the technology we use daily. Major corporations, including Apple and Microsoft, have built upon open source contributions to develop their offerings.

This is why I champion open source and support organizations that do the same. My pride in the open source community and its contributions to technological advancement is unwavering.

Diving into a bit of history can illuminate the profound impact of open source. Take Microsoft's Encarta as an example. It was a leading commercial digital encyclopedia until Wikipedia, a free and open-source platform, entered the scene. The open-source community has dramatically changed how we access information, with Wikipedia serving as a notable illustration. Despite initial doubts from Encarta about Wikipedia's sustainability, it has risen to become the foremost information resource globally. This evolution highlights the power of stigmergyâ€”the idea that the cooperative endeavors of the open-source community can surpass the capabilities of even the most powerful and well-funded organizations.

The then-head of Microsoft, you know who, criticized open source for its potential vulnerabilities to malicious exploitation. I was there in the audience, watching him declare those words on stage at a Comdex event in Las Vegas, completely taken aback. However, the open-source community has continually disproved these claims. Over time, even his views have shifted. The collective intelligence and goodwill of many can indeed overcome the intentions of a few. This is the essence and strength of stigmergy. 

If the first thing that comes to mind when considering open source is financial gain, you're missing the point. The true value lies in the knowledge, experience, and community that open source fosters.

Furthermore, in the long run, these elements contribute to financial success. The knowledge and experience gained through open source can lead to lucrative opportunities and career growth. As exemplified by my journey, the financial rewards may not be immediate, but they are substantial.
