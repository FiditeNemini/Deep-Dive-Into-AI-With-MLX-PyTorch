# Talking About Financial Bubbles Out of Context

Ultimately, everything in the investment arena boils down to hindsight. No one can predict financial bubbles perfectly. Only those who make predictions close to the event gain recognition, and even then, it's still a matter of hindsight.

I know someone who constantly predicts bubbles. Since the beginning of my involvement (decades ago, time flies, doesn't it?), he has seized every opportunity to make his predictions known. He seems born to be a doomsayer. Interestingly, no one pays attention to him until one of his predictions turns out to be correctâ€”a rare occurrence, perhaps one in a hundred. Like a monkey or a child throwing a dart at a dartboard, he occasionally hits the bullseye, well, one in a hundred times, that is.

So, if someone claims they foresaw a financial bubble and says, "I told you so," remind them that I was the one who said, "I told you so," first.

I'm not advocating for a market devoid of bubbles; history has shown us that bubbles are a recurring phenomenon. The real challenge lies not in identifying them but in navigating through them effectively. Acknowledging, as even Buffett concedes, that market timing is a futile endeavor, we must prepare to act with prudence rather than prediction.

The precise moments when a bubble will grow, shrink, or burst remain unpredictable.

Looking back, who would dare label Peter Lynch's 10-baggers, 20-baggers, or even 100-baggers as a bubble? And yet, at the time, plenty of people did. Let's be clear. True wealth is built through surviving bubbles, not sidestepping them. On the flip side, rushing into ephemeral bubbles out of fear of missing out is a surefire way to deplete your resources to the last dime. I still encounter claims of 'bubbles' for my already proven 10-baggers. And for those who gave in to FOMO at the last minute? Well, the outcome is all too familiar.

It feels like a circus out there.

Personally, I take comfort in navigating through bubbles that enhance wealth, whereas those transient bubbles that diminish wealth significantly trouble me. In essence, I favor durable bubbles over the ephemeral, sharp ones. Interestingly, even from a basic statistical standpoint, it's much simpler to identify the former than the latter. Yet, as my experience has shown, only a minority within the investor normal distribution seems to understand this straightforward principle. If you're familiar with me, you'd know how long I've been sharing this 'trade secret' with anyone willing to listen. Have you been paying attention? I thought as much.

This is straightforward logicâ€”visible to all unless obscured by greed. Here's a secret worth sharing: Even Buffett practices restraint over his greed, at least for the most part. What about us, the average folks? Our greed tends to be more pronounced. Hence, we require even greater discipline to moderate our desires.

You might wonder, "What if it's a bubble?" The very question suggests you're not attuned to recognizing such bubbles. If you were, you'd anticipate them comfortably from within. While others rush in with fear of missing out, you fomo out. Conversely, when the crowd exits in panic, you seize the opportunity to fomo in. Ultimately, it boils down to a clear understanding of hindsight.

To sum it up, trust your own informed judgment rather than following the crowd or any so-called experts. Be honest with yourself: if you don't know sh*t, have the courage to get the f*ck out. You must be the master chef in the kitchen of your life. If not, you'll find yourself settling for the leftovers of others' decisions. That's hardly a formula for success.

Did I already drop the bomb that 'financial ethics' feels like a joke, right up there with 'military intelligence'? It's a circus watching folks mix up enemies for allies and vice versa. Can't really blame them, though; we're all just a bunch of greedy bastards at heart.

It's almost hilarious, especially watching CFA hopefuls chuckle over the ethics section. The whole thing plays out like a bad joke. Picture this exam gem: don't frontrun your clients because it's unethical... sure, as if we're gonna buy that bulls*t.

I found the ethics section challenging not because I lack morals, but because the questions felt counterintuitive and nearly deceptive. Taken out of context, some questions bordered on the absurd.

Whenever I get the chance, I emphasize the supreme importance of contextâ€”it's crucial in understanding any situation.

Without proper context, anything can lead you astray. Deliberately removing context borders on unethical behavior, if not outright illegal.

Consider the iconic dot-com tech bubbles, for instance. How many of you actually went through that era, witnessing firsthand how nearly all those ventures turned out to be colossal financial sinkholes? They were nothing but illusions, hindsight being 20/20 and all that. It's a breeze now to claim, "I saw it coming." And yes, they were full of itâ€”never turning a profit, just elaborate schemes to burn cash.

The true profit generators, on the other hand, have been consistently rewarding their investors over the years, even as we speak. Some took their sweet time, but when they hit their stride, they soared high. They were the real McCoy. Does Amazon ring any bells?

If that's considered a bubble, then I'd happily cozy up inside that 'ruggy' bubble. It all boils down to context.

Just for the record, I don't hold any Amazon shares now.

Many who discuss bubbles often turn to charts as their reference. Charts, you say? Ah, charts... Unfortunately, they fail to capture the full context.  No insights there, friends. Sigh.ðŸ˜©

Throwing in another example of apples-to-oranges, just to spice things up.

Picture this: GPUs in today's AI-driven world versus Cisco hardware, looking back through the lens of the tech bubble era. Here's a little nugget for you: I've got Cisco switches pushing past their tenth birthday and they're still kicking like they're fresh out of the box. My collection of seven 10G switches, relics from years gone by, still outperform what my ISP can handle.

This spells a bit of a predicament for Cisco because it nixes any reason for me to shop for upgrades. Let's be real, the typical user isn't hustling to swap out switches or routers every decade. I'm hardly your run-of-the-mill user, but even I'm not on a first-name basis with the Cisco sales rep. The last time I swapped out a switch? Pre-Covid times.

Flip the script to GPUs, and it's a whole different ball game. I'm on a yearly, sometimes bi-yearly, or whenever-the-mood-strikes upgrade cycle. Spot the difference? Plus, those Cisco gadgets run without the need for fancy software frameworks. GPUs? They're the paintbrushes for digital creators, while Cisco's gear is more like the plumbingâ€”essential but static.

Comparing the two? It's like mixing oil and water. There's just no level playing field here.

And oh, about chartsâ€”did I ever mention how they fall short of revealing the true story?

One last piece of wisdom for navigating this ruthless market: don't confuse friends with foes, or foes with friends. It's a wild circus out there, and at our core, we're all just a bunch of greedy bastards.
