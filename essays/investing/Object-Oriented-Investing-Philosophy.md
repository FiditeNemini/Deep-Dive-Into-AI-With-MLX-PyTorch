Allow me to explain clearly why you keep losing money in the stock market.

I can't emphasize enough how object orientation is akin to a life hack. It's an incredibly adaptable tool, applicable across a wide range of domains, including the realm of the stock market.

Consider the concept of "Growth vs. Stalwart."

Traditionally, "Growth" and "Stalwart" are terms categorizing stocks based on their performance patterns and characteristics. These categories draw inspiration from Peter Lynch, a legendary stock picker, who utilized an extensive categorization system. 

The primary distinction between growth and stalwart stocks lies in their growth rates, risk profiles, and reinvestment strategies. Growth stocks are known for rapid expansion and high potential returns, albeit with greater risk. Stalwarts, conversely, are synonymous with steady, reliable growth and income.

Yet these are broad definitions. 'Their' definitions. 

What about 'your' definitions? What about 'your' personal criteria? How do you differentiate between growth and stalwart stocks? Which specific traits and financial metrics do you prioritize? What are your expectations and acceptable risk levels for these stocks?

The stock market is a dynamic, constantly evolving entity, a complex network of companies, investors, and market forces. As an investor, you navigate this complexity, leveraging your experience and expertise to make informed choices.

Indeed, informed decisions are essential. Your choices are not based on mere instinct or guesswork; they are the result of your market knowledge, hands-on experience, and investment philosophy.

So, the pivotal question is:

> How well-informed are your investment decisions?

Investing in stocks inherently involves risk. However, this doesn't necessitate reckless risk-taking. You can be a calculated risk-taker, well-informed about the risks, knowledgeable about the market, and adhering to a clear investment philosophy.

In this regard, growth stocks often seem more attractive than other options, speculative stocks aside. Entering the market means embracing some level of risk. Investing exclusively in stalwart stocks might appear safer, but it's not devoid of risk. If you seek a truly risk-free option, you might consider bonds, though at the expense of potentially higher returns. Therefore, the appeal of growth stocks – they promise higher returns, though with increased risk.

But remember, this is a personal perspective. I believe even if you start with supposedly super risk-free bonds, the allure of the stock market will eventually draw you in. And once involved, you'll become more accustomed to taking risks, possibly even escalating to higher-risk investments. Safer options like stalwart stocks carry their own risks and might be a mere stepping stone towards riskier choices. So why not start with growth stocks? That's my rationale, and it's why I favor growth stocks.

The philosophy here is straightforward: if you're going to take a market risk, aim for the highest return to justify that risk. Stalwart stocks might not offer this; growth stocks do.

What about higher-risk, high-return options like derivatives and cryptocurrencies?

If you're comfortable with such risks, then why not? Personally, I avoid what I consider 'dumb risks' – those contradicting calculated, long-term strategies. Don't be misled by the plethora of charts and tools promising accurate risk and gain predictions. In my view, they give a false sense of security and control, when in reality, you're just another market participant, and the potential for loss is very real. Don't be a sucker for this illusion of control.

> If you’ve been playing poker for half an hour and you still don’t know who the patsy is, you’re the patsy.

Contrary to popular belief, this quote is not from Warren Buffett but is an old poker adage. If you're merely pretending to be savvy in the stock market, you're still the patsy, the easy target.

From my standpoint, the riskiest yet potentially safest bet in the stock market is on growth stocks. That's where I place my bets.

Remember this:

> Every darn thing is an object.

This applies to stocks as well. They are dynamic entities. A stock classified as 'growth' yesterday might be 'stalwart' today and could evolve into a 'speculative' stock tomorrow. The stock market is constantly changing, and stocks adapt with it.

Stocks also demonstrate properties like inheritance and polymorphism, effectively encapsulating their unique characteristics and behaviors. It all starts with the concept of abstraction. Your task is to understand this abstraction, using the right tools – namely, the four pillars of object orientation.

Consider the shared attributes of growth stocks. You can encapsulate these commonalities into an abstract class, then create your own subclassed, concrete classes and instantiate them as individual objects.

These become _your_ growth stocks, defined by your understanding and application of object-oriented principles.

Do you see why I say object orientation is like a life cheat code? It's a powerful approach, applicable even in the stock market. 

Here's a mental model in pseudo-code:

```python
# Python code demonstrating object-oriented principles applied to stock categorization and analysis.

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract Class for Growth Stocks
class GrowthStock(ABC):
    def __init__(self, symbol, current_price):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.current_price = current_price

    @abstractmethod
    def analyze_growth_potential(self):
        """Analyze and return the growth potential of the stock."""
        pass

# Concrete Subclass for a Specific Growth Stock
class TechGrowthStock(GrowthStock):
    def __init__(self, symbol, current_price, projected_growth_rate):
        super().__init__(symbol, current_price)
        self.projected_growth_rate = projected_growth_rate

    def analyze_growth_potential(self):
        # Simplified analysis based on projected growth rate
        if self.projected_growth_rate > 20:
            return "High growth potential"
        elif 10 <= self.projected_growth_rate <= 20:
            return "Moderate growth potential"
        else:
            return "Low growth potential"

# Example of instantiation
my_stock = TechGrowthStock('NO_SUCH_TICKER', 2800, 25)  # Assuming a growth rate of 25%
print(my_stock.analyze_growth_potential())  # Output: High growth potential
```
This pseudo-code illustrates how object-orientation concepts can be applied to categorize and analyze stocks, reflecting your unique investment approach.

The mental model can be as complex or simple as you need. The key is understanding the underlying principles and applying them effectively.

```python
# Simple Python code structure for categorizing stocks using object orientation.

class Stock:
    pass

class StalwartStock(Stock):
    pass    

class GrowthStock(Stock):
    pass

class TechGrowthStock(GrowthStock):
    pass
```

This is my mental model – simple yet powerful. Within this framework, you're free to creatively adapt to the dynamic nature of the stock market.

What about other life domains? Can the same principles be applied?

I posed this set of questions in the following essay:

✍️ The Normal Distribution: Using the Bell Curve as a Life Hack: https://github.com/neobundy/Deep-Dive-Into-AI-With-MLX-PyTorch/blob/master/essays/life/Normal-Distribution-As-A-Life-Hack.md

- Where do you stand in the normal distribution of 'stock investors who truly earn significant returns'?
- Where do you stand in the normal distribution of 'individuals who truly understand the stock market'?
- Where do you stand in the normal distribution of 'individuals who grasp the market, earn significant returns, and sustain them over the long term'?


They're not meant to scare you; they're meant to make you think. Some instinctively know their stuff, while others are clueless. Where do you stand? Some are born with this instinct, while others learn it. Where do you stand? 

Now, consider the above questions again. These considerations should send chills down your spine. 

The philosophy of object-oriented investing is about more than just the mechanics of investing; it's about understanding the market, your place within it, and how to leverage these principles for long-term success.

So, remember:

> Every damn thing is an object.

This mindset is not just a clever approach to investing; it’s a transformative way of thinking, applicable across various aspects of life and decision-making. By framing your understanding and actions within the object-oriented paradigm, you're not just investing in stocks; you're investing in a mindset that cultivates clarity, strategy, and adaptability – key components for success in both the stock market and life.
