I am temporarily suspending the documentation of Apple MLX within my current project.

As the MLX framework is in a state of rapid evolution, it seems wise to monitor its progress for some time.

Initially, I anticipated a seamless transition from PyTorch to MLX. However, this process is turning out to be more intricate than expected. My focus will now be on documenting PyTorch while incorporating MLX examples as feasible.

Given the swift pace and of changes in MLX, I am reluctant to delve deeply into it for my book at present. The risk of the content becoming outdated almost immediately is too high, and I want to avoid the quick obsolescence of significant portions of my work: a sea of deprecation warnings are not what I want to see in my book.

Additionally, I'm uncertain about the framework's best practices due to the limited resources available for verification, unlike with other more established frameworks. I aim to avoid presenting my readers with potentially conflicting information. I hate wasting time myself, and I don't want to waste yours. Better no teaching at all than a bad one, right?

The fundamental principles of the book remain unaltered. It is only the section on MLX documentation that is currently in a state of flux.

Considering my age ðŸ˜‰, I am choosing to allocate my time and energy judiciously, concentrating on the most crucial aspects.

I appreciate your understanding and patience in this matter.

The project will continue to be updated in this repository, focusing primarily on PyTorch. As the MLX framework becomes more stable, I will enrich the book with relevant MLX content.

I am optimistic that Apple will eventually release comprehensive and robust documentation for MLX, complete with an abundance of examples and tutorials befitting its reputation. I am confident they will, though the timing remains uncertain. They are Apple, after all ðŸ¤—

I'll return to documenting MLX once it appears to have established a clear and definitive direction.
